    "### Module 2: Cross-DCC AI Pipeline with USD\n",
    "Concepts\n",
    "USD as the backbone for studio pipelines (assets, materials, lookdev, layout, lighting).\n",
    "USD layers, variants, and composition → non-destructive workflows.\n",
    "AI ↔ USD: training & inference tools working directly on USD scene graphs.\n",
    "Hydra render delegates → AI-assisted preview rendering.\n",
    "Applications\n",
    "Houdini procedural asset → exported as USD → QC via AI → imported into Unreal/Unity/Blender with consistent materials & hierarchy.\n",
    "AI clustering of USD scene assets (group by type, LOD, semantic tags).\n",
    "AI-driven lookdev: auto-assign shaders/materials in USD stage.\n",
    "Real-time USD edits in collaborative workflows with AI assistants.\n",
    "Hands-on\n",
    "Export procedural asset from Houdini as USD.\n",
    "Build Python script for AI-based QC (check mesh integrity, naming, UVs) → auto-tag USD.\n",
    "Import USD into Unreal/Unity → validate materials lookdev.\n",
    "Test AI-driven variant switching (e.g. auto choose LOD variant in USD scene).\n"
