# TechnicalArtist
Introduction
This course is designed for Technical Artists who want to bridge the gap between art, code, and AI. You’ll begin with the core foundations—Python programming, version control with Git, and machine learning essentials—before applying these skills directly to creative workflows in Houdini, Unity, and other industry-standard tools.
As the course progresses, you’ll explore how AI can enhance procedural design, animation, and VFX production. From data extraction and visualization to training custom machine learning models, you’ll gain practical skills that can be integrated into real-world pipelines.
Key areas of focus include:
Computer vision for tracking and analysis in 2D/3D workflows
AI-driven animation and rigging techniques
Generative 3D models for environments, characters, and assets
Reinforcement learning for intelligent agents in games and simulations
In the final stage, you’ll dive into end-to-end ML pipelines, experiment with neural style transfer, and explore AI-powered tools for game development and VFX.
By the end of the course, you will not only understand the technical foundations of AI but also know how to apply them creatively to push the boundaries of art, interactivity, and procedural workflows as a modern Technical Artist.
